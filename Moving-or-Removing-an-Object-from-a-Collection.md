# Moving (Replace) or Removing (Remove) an Object from a Collection

There are a handful of ways to do this in Alma, with or without Primo.  The technique I use looks like this...  

1) Find the object(s) in `Primo` using a search.  You could also do this in `Alma`, but searching in `Primo` is generally easier and the options you have generally provide better control and results.     

In this example the objects to be moved were errantly in the `PHPP - Community Contributions` collection (they should be in `Drake Community Archives`) and all had the term `cyclone` in the title.  So, I searched the `PHPP - Community Contributions` collection for `cyclone` and got the result you see below.

2) For each object to be moved, open the object in `Primo` and copy its `MMS_ID`.  

3) Open the corresponding object in `Alma` using the `MMS_ID` as search criteria there, as shown below.

4) With the object displayed in `Alma`, click on the `Collections (n)` link either at the bottom of the record display or on the right.  

5) Confirm that the collection list is correct or not.  If a change is necessary click on the `...` menu associated with the errant collection name, like so:

6) Click `Remove` to remove the object from the collection, or more likely, the `Replace` option to MOVE the object from its current collection to another.  

7) With the `Replace` option you will be prompted to search for and select the target collection.  

8) Confirm your `Remove` or `Replace` selection if prompted to do so and `Select` to complete the operation if needed.    

9) Repeat steps 2 through 8 as needed.
