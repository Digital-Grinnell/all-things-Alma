Case Title: Alma Chat - Alma-D Missing Object(s)  
Last Comment:  
Hello again, Mark -  

In conferred with our Tier 2 experts, and "grinnell:16819" matched on the dcterms:abstract field "1948 postmark. Number 168-19." because the All titles "keywords" search casts a notably wide net; this is expected behavior and cannot be changed. Primo does not use the same db/solr indexing that Alma uses, which is why you are not seeing the same result in Primo. You can read more about searching in Alma on the following page:  
https://knowledge.exlibrisgroup.com/Alma/Product_Documentation/010Alma_Online_Help_(English)/010Getting_Started/050Alma_User_Interface_%E2%80%93_General_Information/Searching_in_Alma  

Moving forward it is recommended to use the Digital titles : dc:identifier search index when searching for values like "grinnell:16819" so that it only searches the identifier field in question:

Since Alma only accepts CSV files for imports of this nature at this time I highly recommend submitting an idea on the ideas exchange to expand the kinds of files that are accepted:

Please let us know if there's anything else we can address at this time.

Description:  
Got an interesting problem today. We have just completed migration of around 12000 digital objects into Alma-D and today I find at least ONE is missing. The object should have a dc:identifier value of "grinnell:16819" but I can't find it in Primo or Alma.  

I'm looking for a way to search results of past import jobs to see if that identifier comes up.  

I have the digital object here, a postcard image, but I'd like to find the source of the omission so I can see if the problem was isolated to the one object or if more might be missing.  

One of the adjacent objects has a Modification Date of Modification Date 03/17/2025 14:49:35 CDT and a Creation Date 10/21/2024 17:24:36 CDT
