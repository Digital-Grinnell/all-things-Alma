# Force Re-indexing of Objects/Titles

In a support chat conversation in early December 2025, an ExLibris agent suggested that one can force re-indexing of digital objects (to remedy display and discovery issues in Primo) by...

1) Adding the target objects to an itemized set, and
2) Running the `Recalculate Local Resource Types` job (ID: 08269603) with the set.
