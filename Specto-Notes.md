FYI for those of y'all going to ELUNA: 

Dear Alma Digital community,  

I’m Shmuel Ohayon, the new Director of Product for Alma Specto, our new AI-powered Digital Asset Management solution built on top of Alma Digital.  

We will be attending ELUNA this year and would love to meet anyone from this group who will be there as well. If you’re attending and interested in discussing Alma Specto for your institution or sharing your thoughts on digital collection needs, feel free to reach out to me privately and we can arrange a time to connect.  

Looking forward to seeing some of you there!  

Best Regards,  
Shmuel Ohayon  
Director, Product Management
