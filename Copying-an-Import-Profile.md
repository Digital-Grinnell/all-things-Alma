# Copying an Import Profile

Case Title: Alma Chat - migration into Alma-D
Last comment:
Hi Mark,

I am sorry we couldn't answer faster. It should be possible to "Copy" an Import Profile. Here is a visual: **https://go.screenpal.com/watch/cTfnYyniLXG**  

I suggest testing on small scale first, to be sure that the copied import profile, with any changes that you may add - will achieve what you seek.  

Please let me know if there are questions or clarifications,  
Thank you!

I've just completed a large migration into Alma-D and did so using an import profile modified from dcap01. Now I'd like to copy that profile to replace dcap02 so that I can remove some "migration-specific" columns. My intent is to use the new dcap02 replacement for bulk import of new objects. Is there a way to "copy" an existing import profile?
Or do I have to painstakingly create the new profile much like I did for the migration profile?  

I'm currently looking at https://grinnell.alma.exlibrisgroup.com/ng/page;u=%2Frep%2Faction%2FpageAction.do%3FxmlFileName%3Dmdprofile.dc.tabs.dc_profile_edit_fields.xml&operation%3DLOAD&pageViewMode%3DEdit&pageBean.mdProfileId%3D2001&pageBean.module%3DREASOURCE_MANAGEMENT&almaConfiguration%3Dtrue&pageBean.securityHashToken%3D3358068675517498505. 

That is my "migration" dcap01 profile.
